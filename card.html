				The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a
				white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped.
				Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism
				is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.
